### Frame stacking

### Single model training
* Set the 'new_training_ option on global_defs.py to 'True'
* If the backbone is not meant to be a run-time input command, define the name of the backbone in the 'single_backbone_for_training' option.
* Set the 'start' and 'end' variables in global_defs.py to the initial and final indices of the image stacks that will be used for training.


### Ensemble training

### Extracting prediction mean and standard deviation

### Ensemble inference
