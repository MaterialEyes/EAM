# About

The repository, Vision_for_Microscopy, has been created to archive the code written as part of the projects undertaken in collaboration between Dr Maria Chan's group and the microscopy facilities at Argonne National Laboratory. 

Specifically, the papers associated with each of the sub-folders are:

* ensemble_for_phase_seg: Workshop on Machine Learning for Materials Science, KDD 2022.
* optical_flow_for_phonon_fingerprints: Manuscript in preparation

### The following is the directory structure of this repository:
